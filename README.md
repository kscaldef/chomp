chomp
=====

A simple game to play against the computer

Based on Bart Massey's Open Source Bridge workshop, "Shall We Play A Game?": http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/974

The goal of chomp is to force your opponent to take the last square on
the board.  Whoever takes the last (upper left) square loses.  To
play, just type

> sbt run

And then enter the coordinates you want to take, separated by a space.
